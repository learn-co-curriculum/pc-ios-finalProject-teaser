# Final Project Teaser

For your final project, you will have the chance to use [NYC Open Data](https://nycopendata.socrata.com/) and your new knowledge of how to access user location to build an app that makes it easier for New Yorkers to live, work, or play.

Use the NYC Open Data site to check out the following data sets:

+ Wifi location
+ Subway locations
+ SAT scores
+ 311 service request
+ Filming locations
+ Art galleries
+ Farmers  Markets
+ After school programs

**The challenge for this week is to think about an app you can build that utilizes one of these datasets.**  Next week we will show you how to bring the data into your app.
